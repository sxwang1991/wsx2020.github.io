>+ # Fresh start

&emsp;&emsp;College is a unique mix of freedom and responsibility.
It is hard to express how profound  a change college represents in 
the lives of new students: 
new homes, new lifestyles, new people, ande a wealth of new learning opportunities.
Facing all of these many changes, you must choose responsibily and wisely.

&emsp;&emsp; College is a fresh start in your life.
You will find your college experience more rewarding if you consider some important questions:
What are your expectation?
What does this opportunity offer?
How will you make the most of this marvelous opportunity and exciting new 
experience?
What will you do to ensure that the journey you begin at university today leads you toward a bright and successful future?
Listen to your university president, your teachers, and your parents and see
what suggestions they have for you.

>+ # Loving parents, loving children

&emsp;&emsp;The relationship between children and parents can be one of the most difficult, and yet, one of the most important relationships of all.
To reach maturity, the child must pass through the many changes of childhood before stepping into the role of an adult.
Imagine how difficult it is for your parents to change, too!
They have known you as a dependent baby, adolescent and teenager.
Changing, learning and growing, each generation marches through the stages of life.
In those moments when the world around us melts away, we can clearly see the love feelings between parents and children.
Time slow down and the love flows in -- parent to child and back again.
Think about your own parents and the love you share.
What special moments, either easy or hard, have shown the love between you and your parents?
Now that you are away at the university, what will you do to help your parent
begin to see you as an adult?
How will you honor and sustain the love you share?

>+ # Digital campus

&emsp;&emsp;Communications technology, including Internet access, is connected to many parts of your life at the university.
It links with your studies, your teachers, other students, and the world.
Within seconds, it gives you access to a sea of information as well as the ability to communicate anytime, anywhere, whether by voice, email or text.

&emsp;&emsp;Instant Internet access and connectivity are huge gift.
At the same time, it is important to watch how much time you spend online as too much of a good thing may become something bad.
That is because even the Internet increses efficiency and frees you up, it also presents challenges as to when to turn off the virtual world and to reengage with the real world. 
How will you set limits on the online time to gain the benifits of Internet connectivity while avoiding its pitfalls?
How will you balance your time online with life in the real world?

>+ # Heroes of our time

&emsp;&emsp; The stories of heroes inspire and encourage us.
Sometimes a hero achieves great things.
Other times, however strong their will is, they fail to achieve their goal.
Then what makes a hero?
Some say they have special qualities the ordinary people can never acquire.
Some say the main ingredient for a hero is simply the determination to do what is best and to serve those in need. In fact, everyday heros are all around us.
You too can be one of the ordinary people who do extraordinay things! 
What will you do to become more courageous?
How will you strengthen your own abilities and determination to be ready to act heroically if the call comes?
